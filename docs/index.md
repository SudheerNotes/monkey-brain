## Welcome to Monkey Brain

It's unusual to call this website as a `MonkeyBrain` considering the fact that a human is actually writing this content. 

Jokes aside, its a repository of all my learnings documented and strictured in a way that I can retrieve easily to reduce cognitive load on my mind.

## Main Topics:

- Programming (Python & Pytorch)  
- Deep Learning
- Mathematics & Statistics concepts
